CALENDAR: Email NAME from COMPANY on DAY



SUBJECT: Summer internship opportunities



Good TIME NAME,

My name is Winson Luk, and I am currently an undergraduate at UC San Diego studying computer engineering. I am genuinely interested in gaining practical experience at COMPANY, and I believe that I would be an excellent fit in any team that is in need of a summer intern.

I am aware of the opportunities articulated on your website, and I wanted to take the initiative of contacting you directly for recruitment. I have attached my resume and cover letter for consideration, and you may visit my website at winsonluk.com to learn more about my skills, projects, and passions.

Please let me know if there is a convenient time to briefly interview for potential internship opportunities over the summer. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Regards,
Winson
